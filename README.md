# Internet Commentator Murder Mystery

A narrative mystery game.

In the wake of a series of killings that are picking off internet commentators one-by-one, you win
points for winning pseudo-intellectual debates about the killings as the murderer continues to 
kill, unabated.

Built for the (Cleveland branch of the) 2024 Global Game Jam.
